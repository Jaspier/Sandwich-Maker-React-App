# Sandwich-Maker-React-App
Sandwich Maker is a responsive web app built with the latest version of ES6 React.js. Users must sign up or sign in to an existing account so that they can make sandwiches, order them, and fetch their previous orders specific to their user id.

The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The backend utilises third-party packages such as axios for post and get requests. I used Firebase to store data in a real-time database and hosted on Firebase.
